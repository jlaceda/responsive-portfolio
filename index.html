            <p>I'm John Michael Laceda. I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer
                with an extensive tech background in supporting backend
                services. I hail from a land across the Great Puget Sound in
                Bremerton Washington. I currently sail into Seattle for work
                everyday! My beautiful fianc√©e and I take care of a cute little
                Rat-Cha (Chihuahua / Rat Terrier mix) named Bella and an old
                spinster Tabby named Pudgy. </p>
            <p>I grew up in the Philippines and survived a <a target="blank"

                    eruption</a> before my family and I emigrated to The United
                States of America.</p>
            <p>In high school I took a Computer Aided Drafting class as an
                elective. This set me on a course to wanting to learn all about
                computers and started breaking and fixing (if I was lucky!) our
                family computer. I started to get into Linux and eventually got
                a job supporting back end services run on Linux servers.</p>
            <p>My hobbies are fleeting obsessions. As a youth I was into very
                music so I joined a couple of garage bands that fizzled out.
                Around the same time I got into competitive video games with
                pipe dreams of being a <a target="blank"
                    href="https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Bonjwa">Brood War
                    bonjwa</a> but I was never really good. I've forced a friend
                group to play a Dungeons and Dragons campaign and Magic: the
                Gathering (which is objectively the best game), both which are
                collecting dust somewhere.</p>
            <p>My passion for the internet and computers never waned and I am in
                fact doubling down and will be putting my mark out there in the
                cloud. Developing part of what's out there in the public
                internet for anyone to see sounds to exciting to me!</p>
